oldnotes

Small JACK MIDI client that replaces velocities of specified notes with that of
the previously received non-specified notes.

One JACK MIDI input port and one output port is created. All input is passed to
the output, except that, for the notes specified, the velocities are modified
to be that of the last received non-specified note.
